The technique selected for multiplexing was packet
switching. An alternative such as circuit switching could
have been considered, but the applications being
supported, such as remote login, were naturally served
by the packet switching paradigm, and the networks
which were to be integrated together in this project were
packet switching networks. So packet switching was
accepted as a fundamental component of the Internet
architecture.
