# Notes
## Packet Switching
The technique selected for multiplexing was packet
switching. An alternative such as circuit switching could
have been considered, but the applications being
supported, such as remote login, were naturally served
by the packet switching paradigm, and the networks
which were to be integrated together in this project were
packet switching networks. So packet switching was
accepted as a fundamental component of the Internet
architecture.

## Second Level Goal (7)
During wartime,
one is less concerned with detailed accounting of
resources used than with mustering whatever resources
are available and rapidly deploying them in an
operational manner. While the architects of the Internet
were mindful of accountability, the problem received
very little attention during the early stages of the design,
and is only now being considered.

Not a motherhood list.
